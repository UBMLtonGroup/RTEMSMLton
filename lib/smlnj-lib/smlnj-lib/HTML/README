This library provides support for parsing and pretty-printing HTML.
The file html-sig.sml and html.sml define a parse-tree representation
of HTML 3.2 (as defined in the January 14th 1997 specification).

The HTML structure implements a collection of datatypes
that describe the syntax of HTML trees according to the 3.2 spec.
The library provides support for parsing and printing these
datatypes.  The functor HTMLParserFn implements the parser and
the PrHTML structure provides printing of HTML trees.  Also, there
is a structure called MakeHTML, which provides helper functions for
constructing HTML trees (mostly defaults of attribute values).

Note that this is a fairly strict interpretation of the standard;
non-standard tags and attributes will cause errors.  To allow some
flexibility, the parser is functorized over a collection of error
reporting functions (see html-error-sig.sml).

The file test-parser.sml gives an example of how the parser part of the
library can be used.

TODO LIST:

The parser has trouble with white-space in the <HEAD>.

The pretty-printer needs to be rewritten to deal with line breaks better.

Some library support for entities (e.g., "&lt;" should be provided).
