MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for the Standard ML
programming language. See README.original for MLton's feature
description.

This is a port of MLton to RTEMS X86. 

Compiling:

1. Make sure you have installed RTEMS
2. Cross compile GMP with RTEMS's toolchain
3. Modify the RTEMS and GMP variable in compile-rtems.sh accordingly
4. RTEMS, GMP and GMP_LIB in rtems-mlton to Step 3 as well.
5. First, run ./compile.sh (Dont't worry it fails.. it fails at where it should)
6. Compile ./compile-rtems.sh
7. Now you can compile your program as:

    ./rtems-compile.sh filename.sml

8. You need to allocate 4G memory for qemu. The rtems-run.sh script wraps the 
   command and can be used to run the compiled image
