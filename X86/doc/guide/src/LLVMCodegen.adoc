LLVMCodegen
===========

The <:LLVMCodegen:> is a <:Codegen:code generator> that translates the
<:Machine:> <:IntermediateLanguage:> to <:LLVM:> assembly, which is
further optimized and compiled to native object code by the <:LLVM:>
toolchain.

It requires <:LLVM:> version 3.3 or greater to be installed.

In benchmarks performed on the <:RunningOnAMD64:AMD64> architecture,
code size with this generator is usually slightly smaller than either
the <:AMD64Codegen:native> or the <:CCodegen:C> code generators. Compile
time is worse than <:AMD64Codegen:native>, but slightly better than
<:CCodegen:C>. Run time is often better than either <:AMD64Codegen:native>
or <:CCodegen:C>.

== Details and Notes ==

The <:LLVMCodegen:> was initially developed by Brian Leibig (see
<!Cite(Leibig13,An LLVM Back-end for MLton)>).
